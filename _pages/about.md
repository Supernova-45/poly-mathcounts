**Poly's middle school math team** provides an outlet for students to explore **mathematics** and **problem-solving** that extends beyond the scope of the traditional school curriculum.

By competing in **local and national math contests** -- including MATHCOUNTS, the AMC 8, Math League, Vanguard Math Tournament, and Purple Comet! -- students tackle challenging problems and collaborate closely with classmates across grade levels.

All interested middle school students, regardless of background or experience, are welcome to participate.

**Meetings take place on Mondays and Thursdays from 3:30-5pm in the 6th grade English classroom.**

**Contact akim24@students.polytechnic.org with questions.**
