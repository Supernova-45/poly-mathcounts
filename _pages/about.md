Poly's team competes in local and national math contests, including MATHCOUNTS, AMC 8, Math League, Vanguard Math Tournament, Purple Comet!, and more. We welcome all interested middle school students, regardless of background or experience.

Meetings take place on Mondays and Thursdays from 3:30-5pm in the 6th grade English classroom.
